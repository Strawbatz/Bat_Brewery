  TextbookDescription: "Recognised by its iconic twisted shape, twisters are a waterweed
    which naturally grow in rapids and rivers. \r\nTheir peculiar shape allows for
    efficient filtering of water, producing clear and clean water. These are often
    planted in water bodies supporting towns, and also wells. \r\n\r"
