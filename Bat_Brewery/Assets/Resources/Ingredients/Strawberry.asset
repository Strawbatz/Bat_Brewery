  TextbookDescription: "These berries are rare to find in the wild, but can often
    be found close to farmlands. The small bush which produces the berries requires
    complex care. Once the needed care is given it often spreads a bit further outside
    of the farmlands. \r\nThe sweet berries are known for their delicious flavor,
    and have a brilliant maroon color. \r\nA fully grown plant can produce approximately
    8 berries at the same time. \r"
