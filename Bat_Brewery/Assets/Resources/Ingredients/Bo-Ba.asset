  TextbookDescription: "Bo-Ba bushes naturally grow on mountains and sometimes at
    the very edges of forests. Bo-Ba berries are categorized as small berries. \r\nThe
    berries should not be consumed raw because of their rock-like shell.  \r\nThe
    berries usually grow in small groups of four or five.\r"
