  TextbookDescription: "These flowers are often found on barren mountain sides. They
    initially appear quite fragile because of how quickly they appear to wilt and
    dry out. However this is simply the appearance of the matured flower as it will
    remain standing as their seeds continue to develop. \r\nHistorically, Wilflow
    has been a symbol associated with both life and death.\r"
