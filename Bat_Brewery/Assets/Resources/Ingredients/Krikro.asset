  TextbookDescription: "The Krikro tree is recognized by its long and curly vines,
    and grows on open fields. When the wind blows through the vines it sometimes
    sounds like voices singing. \r\nThe curly vines often grow into complex knots,
    which is what causes the sound when the wind blows through.\r"
