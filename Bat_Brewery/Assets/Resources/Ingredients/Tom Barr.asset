  TextbookDescription: "Although the Tom Barr tree is closely related to the spruce
    species, these trees rarely grow to be taller than 2 meters. According to some
    local myths this tree originated from a faraway ancient region in the north.\r\nThis
    species of tree is covered in small and soft needles instead of leaves. The needles
    can be grinded down and dried into a powder. This powder is often used as a base
    for medicinal potions.\r"
