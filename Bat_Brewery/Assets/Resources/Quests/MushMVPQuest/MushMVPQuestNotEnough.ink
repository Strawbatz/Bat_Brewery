Hi again Fabian.
Oh, it looks like you havent gathered the correct ingredients yet.
Remember, I need two ingredients:
First I need Mynta: While they might look like a natural part of the tree at first, they are actually parasitic plants. When walking by they give off a fresh smell. The leaves are small but thick. A common nickname is mice pillow.
Second I need Swomp: A tall and slender mushrooms which grow in small clusters in dark forests. These small mushrooms are safe to eat and their soft hats are a tasty treat. A very common mushroom.
Come back to me when you have gathered the correct ingredients!
