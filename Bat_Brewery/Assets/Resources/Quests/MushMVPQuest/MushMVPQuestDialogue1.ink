Hi there, i am Mush the Mushman.
I heard tha you where Fabian and that you just moved into this old house.
I did also hear that you are a powerful wich. Therefore I have a request to make of you. 
I need to bake a magical cake for my wifes birhtday, for the magical cake I need two ingredients.
First I need Mynta; While they might look like a natural part of the tree at first, they are actually parasitic plants. When walking by they give off a fresh smell. The leaves are small but thick. A common nickname is mice pillow.
Second I need Swomp; A tall and slender mushrooms which grow in small clusters in dark forests. These small mushrooms are safe to eat and their soft hats are a tasty treat. A very common mushroom.
Could you give those ingredients to me? I would of course pay you for your effort.
